## Abstract

Published claims about executors, networking, and unification shaped a decade of committee decisions. The published evidence behind those claims is documented here.

This paper surveys the published claims that shaped the trajectory of executors, networking, and asynchronous programming in C++. Each claim is presented verbatim with its source. For each claim, the published record was searched for supporting evidence - user surveys, deployment data, prototypes, experiments, measurements. Where evidence was found, it is documented. Where the published record contains no evidence, the cell is empty.

## 1. Disclosure

The author provides information and serves at the pleasure of the committee.

This paper is part of the Network Endeavor, a project to bring coroutine-native byte-oriented I/O to C++.

The author developed and maintains [Capy](https://github.com/cppalliance/capy)<sup>[2]</sup> and [Corosio](https://github.com/cppalliance/corosio)<sup>[1]</sup> and believes coroutine-native I/O is the correct foundation for networking in C++.

Coroutine-native I/O and `std::execution` address different domains and should coexist in the C++ standard.

This paper examines the published record. That effort requires re-examining consequential papers, including papers written by people the author respects.

**Selection criteria.** Claims were selected from the papers in the causal chain documented in the companion papers - [P4094R0](https://wg21.link/p4094r0)<sup>[3]</sup>, [P4095R0](https://wg21.link/p4095r0)<sup>[4]</sup>, [P4096R0](https://wg21.link/p4096r0)<sup>[5]</sup>, and [P4097R0](https://wg21.link/p4097r0)<sup>[6]</sup> - plus additional claims from [P2453R0](https://wg21.link/p2453r0)<sup>[17]</sup> and [P2470R0](https://wg21.link/p2470r0)<sup>[18]</sup> that shaped the committee's direction. Claims from both sides of the debate were included: the unification proponents (P0443, P0761R2, P1525R0), the P2464R0 diagnosis, the P2469R0 response, the P2300 deployment claims, and the pro-Networking-TS claims (Section 2.6). The published record was searched using all WG21 papers available to the author through the March 2026 mailing.

**Evidence bar.** The bar for evidence is deliberately low. A code snippet from a real codebase counts. A prototype counts. A survey of even a handful of users counts. A hypothetical code example constructed by the author counts - the table notes it. Where the Evidence column is empty, the search found nothing.

**Limitations.** The author acknowledges that absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. Committee discussions occur in rooms, hallways, dinners, and private channels that leave no public trace. Committee members bring domain expertise to polls and design reviews that is not captured in published papers; the absence of a published document does not mean the absence of informed judgment. If a reader is aware of a document, analysis, or discussion that this paper's research did not reach, the author welcomes the correction and will update the record in a future revision.

This paper asks for nothing.

## 3. Observations

This paper does not draw conclusions from the table. Four observations are offered for the reader's consideration.

**The deployment evidence for GPU dispatch and infrastructure is real.** [P2470R0](https://wg21.link/p2470r0)<sup>[18]</sup> documents sender/receiver at scale at Facebook, NVIDIA, and Bloomberg. The committee's decision to move beyond [P0443R14](https://wg21.link/p0443r14)<sup>[21]</sup> addressed genuine deficiencies in the unified executor model. `std::execution` provides a composition algebra that neither the Networking TS nor the coroutine model provides. These are real achievements supported by published evidence.

**The evidence is concentrated in one domain.** The deployment evidence (P2470R0) documents sender/receiver at scale for GPU dispatch, thread pools, and infrastructure. No published paper documents production-scale networking using the sender model. The poll that included "networking" in its text (P2453R0 Poll 2) achieved consensus without published networking evidence.

**The continuation framing was not examined.** No claim in the table was analyzed under both the work framing and the continuation framing at the time it was made. The companion papers in this series ([P4095R0](https://wg21.link/p4095r0)<sup>[4]</sup>, [P4096R0](https://wg21.link/p4096r0)<sup>[5]</sup>) provide that analysis retroactively.

**The evidence bar was not applied uniformly.** Some claims in the table are supported by deployment data, prototypes, or code examples. Others are supported by nothing in the published record. Both categories shaped committee decisions. This is not unusual in standards work - committee members bring domain expertise to polls and design reviews that is not captured in published papers. The absence of a published document does not mean the absence of informed judgment. It does mean the judgment is not available for independent review.

---

## 4. Anticipated Objections

**Q: Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.**

A: Section 1 says so. The table documents what the published record contains. If evidence exists in unpublished form, the author welcomes the correction.

**Q: This cherry-picks claims.**

A: The table includes claims from both sides - P2464R0's diagnosis, P2469R0's response, P1791R0's defense of P0443, P2470R0's deployment data, and the pro-Networking-TS claims in Section 2.6. If a reader is aware of a published claim that this paper omitted, the author will add it in a future revision.

**Q: The committee had private discussions that informed these decisions.**

A: Section 1 acknowledges this. The published record is the only record this paper can examine. Decisions that affect the entire C++ ecosystem deserve a published evidence base.

**Q: You are arguing for your own library.**

A: Section 1 discloses this. The claims and evidence in the table are verbatim quotes from published papers. They stand or fall on the published record, not on who assembled them.
