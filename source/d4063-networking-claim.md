## Abstract

The committee expressed consensus that sender/receiver is a good basis for networking. The published evidence behind that word is documented here.

In October 2021, LEWG polled: "The sender/receiver model (P2300) is a good basis for most asynchronous use cases, including networking, parallelism, and GPUs" (SF:24 / WF:16 / N:3 / WA:6 / SA:3 - consensus in favor). This paper searches the published record for the evidence that supported the word "networking" in that poll text - at the time of the vote and as of 2026. It is the fourth in a series of six papers that document the decisions that kept networking out of the C++ standard.

## Revision History

### R0: March 2026 (post-Croydon mailing)

- Initial version.

---

## 1. Disclosure

The author developed and maintains [Corosio](https://github.com/cppalliance/corosio)<sup>[1]</sup> and [Capy](https://github.com/cppalliance/capy)<sup>[2]</sup> and believes coroutine-native I/O is the correct foundation for networking in C++. Coroutine-native I/O does not provide the sender composition algebra - `retry`, `when_all`, `upon_error` - that `std::execution` provides. The author provides information, asks nothing, and serves at the pleasure of the chair.

The author is revisiting the historical record systematically. This paper is one of several. The goal is to document - precisely and on the record - the decisions that kept networking out of the C++ standard. That effort requires re-examining consequential papers, including papers written by people the author respects.

### P2469R0

The author is a co-author of [P2469R0](https://wg21.link/p2469r0)<sup>[3]</sup>, "Response to P2464: The Networking TS is baked, P2300 Sender/Receiver is not," which argued in October 2021 that the Networking TS was more mature than P2300. The reader should be aware that the author had a prior published position on the relationship between the Networking TS and [P2300](https://wg21.link/p2300)<sup>[4]</sup>.

### Methodology and Limitations

The author's research method is systematic search of the published record - WG21 papers, published poll outcomes, and public mailing list archives. Every source cited in this paper is a published WG21 paper available on open-std.org or a published presentation available through wg21.link.

The author also searched the LEWG reflector archives for evidence of sender-based networking deployments, prototypes, or implementations. No such deployment was identified. The reflector is not a public source and its contents are not quoted in this paper.

The author acknowledges that absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. Committee discussions occur in rooms, hallways, dinners, and private channels that leave no public trace. Evidence that P2300 works for networking may exist in unpublished prototypes, internal deployments, or private communications. The author cannot prove that such evidence does not exist. If a reader is aware of a published document, deployment, or prototype that this paper's research did not reach, the author welcomes the correction and will update the record in a future revision.

## 2. The Poll

[P2453R0](https://wg21.link/p2453r0)<sup>[5]</sup>, "2021 October Library Evolution Poll Outcomes" (Bryce Adelstein Lelbach, Fabio Fracassi, Ben Craig, 2022), documents the following poll:

> "The sender/receiver model (P2300) is a good basis for most asynchronous use cases, including networking, parallelism, and GPUs."
>
> SF:24 / WF:16 / N:3 / WA:6 / SA:3 - Consensus in favor.

The chair's published interpretation:

> "What this doesn't mean: It doesn't mean that S&R is going into C++23 (though it might). It doesn't mean that P2300R2 as it stands today will be sent forward to Library. It doesn't prevent us from adding new asynchronous models in the future."
>
> "What this means: Work will continue in Library Evolution on refining P2300R2, and Library Evolution will keep the various asynchronous use cases in mind while working on P2300R2."

### 2.1 Context

In WG21, the people who write proposals are often the same people who present them, champion them, and participate in the polls that advance them. This is normal and expected - domain experts are the people best positioned to do the work. The following co-authorships are documented for completeness, not as a criticism. Bryce Adelstein Lelbach served as LEWG Chair and is a co-author of [P2300R10](https://wg21.link/p2300r10)<sup>[4]</sup>. Eric Niebler authored the [P2300](https://wg21.link/p2300)<sup>[4]</sup> presentation slides ([P2470R0](https://wg21.link/p2470r0)<sup>[9]</sup>) and is a co-author of [P2300R10](https://wg21.link/p2300r10)<sup>[4]</sup> and [P1525R0](https://wg21.link/p1525r0)<sup>[10]</sup>. Both contributed substantially to the design that the poll evaluated. The poll was open to all LEWG members and the results reflect the committee's collective judgment.

### 2.2 Selected Voter Comments

[P2453R0](https://wg21.link/p2453r0)<sup>[5]</sup> Section 4.2 publishes selected comments from voters on Poll 2. The following comments address the networking component of the poll. All quotes are verbatim from the published paper.

Voters who stated they could not evaluate the networking claim:

> "I think this is a good basis for parallelism/GPUs but can't judge its suitability for networking."
>
> - Weakly Favor

> "My vote is weakly in favor as I am not familiar enough with the networking requirements to be sure that it satisfies those, but for the other domains I am confident it does. If this were only for the parallelism and GPUs use case I would vote strongly in favour."
>
> - Weakly Favor

> "P2300R2 has not been around as long as Asio and hasn't been 'tried by fire' in the networking domain. I'm pretty familiar with special cases of networking for parallel computing, but not generally familiar with 'doing networking in C++,' so I'm voting WF instead of SF."
>
> - Weakly Favor

> "I think the general direction of sender/receiver more closely matches the semantics of the language and normal functions with regards to its handling of separate value/error channels... However, I do not think that sender/receiver is sufficiently well-baked to be included in C++23, and could do with some more refinement to address issues raised and more implementation experience."
>
> - Weakly Favor

These votes counted toward the "consensus in favor" that included networking.

## 3. The Evidence at the Time of the Vote

The poll was taken in October 2021. This section documents the published evidence that existed at that time regarding the sender/receiver model's suitability for networking.

### 3.1 Published Deployments

[P2470R0](https://wg21.link/p2470r0)<sup>[9]</sup> (Niebler, 2021), the P2300 presentation slides, documented the following deployments:

> "Sender/receiver as specified in P2300R2 is currently being used in the following shipping Facebook products: Facebook Messenger on iOS, Android, Windows, and macOS; Instagram on iOS and Android; Facebook on iOS and Android; Portal; An internal Facebook product that runs on Linux."

> "'NVIDIA is fully invested in P2300 senders/receivers; we believe it is the correct basis for portable asynchronous and heterogeneous execution in Standard C++ across all platforms, including CPUs, GPUs, and other accelerators...'"

| Deployment    | Domain                                 | Networking evidence |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Facebook      | Mobile apps, infrastructure            |                     |
| NVIDIA        | GPU dispatch, heterogeneous execution  |                     |
| Bloomberg     | Experimentation                        |                     |

### 3.2 The P2300R2 Networking Example

[P2300R2](https://wg21.link/p2300r2)<sup>[11]</sup> Section 1.4 contains a networking example using `NN::async_read_some` and `NN::async_write_some`:

> "In this code, `NN::async_read_some` and `NN::async_write_some` are asynchronous socket-based networking APIs that return senders."

The `NN::` namespace prefix is a placeholder. The example is a hypothetical illustration constructed by the proposal authors. It is not drawn from a deployed codebase.

### 3.3 Published Evidence Against

[P2430R0](https://wg21.link/p2430r0)<sup>[12]</sup> (Kohlhoff, August 2021), "Partial success scenarios with P2300," was published two months before the poll. The paper documented that compound I/O results - an error code and a byte count - cannot be routed onto the sender's three completion channels without information loss:

> "Due to the limitations of the set_error channel (which has a single 'error' argument) and set_done channel (which takes no arguments), partial results must be communicated down the set_value channel."

## 4. The Evidence as of 2026

### 4.1 Papers by Other Authors

[P2762R2](https://wg21.link/p2762r2)<sup>[13]</sup> (K&uuml;hl, 2023), "Sender/Receiver Interface For Networking," is the first published paper proposing sender-based networking APIs. It was published two years after the poll. Section 4.2 documents five routing options for I/O results onto sender channels and writes:

> "some of the error cases may have been partial successes. In that case, using the set_error channel taking just one argument is somewhat limiting."

The concern [P2430R0](https://wg21.link/p2430r0)<sup>[12]</sup> raised in August 2021 - before the poll - remains documented in the literature as of 2023.

[N4985](https://wg21.link/n4985)<sup>[23]</sup>, the St. Louis 2024 minutes, records the moment [P2300R10](https://wg21.link/p2300r10)<sup>[4]</sup> was adopted into the C++ working paper:

> "One national body reported that individual members had concerns. They would like to postpone this until Poland in order to increase concerns. The concerns are mostly about teachability and user story for beginners."

[P3801R0](https://wg21.link/p3801r0)<sup>[24]</sup> (M&uuml;ller, 2025) writes:

> "P3552R3, proposing the coroutine task type `std::execution::task`, was approved in Sofia for inclusion in C++26. I have strong concerns about its design and urge the committee to reconsider."

### 4.3 The Timeline

- [N1925](https://wg21.link/n1925)<sup>[22]</sup> (2005): first networking proposal.
- Networking TS published as ISO TS (2018).
- [P2453R0](https://wg21.link/p2453r0)<sup>[5]</sup> (October 2021): "including networking." Consensus in favor.
- [P2762R2](https://wg21.link/p2762r2)<sup>[13]</sup> (2023): first sender-based networking API proposal.
- 2026: no sender-based networking has shipped. Networking is not in the C++ standard. Twenty-one years from [N1925](https://wg21.link/n1925)<sup>[22]</sup>.

## 5. Anticipated Objections

**Q: The poll said "good basis," not "ready to ship."**

A: Section 2 quotes the chair's interpretation. The poll's outcome shaped the committee's direction. [P2453R0](https://wg21.link/p2453r0)<sup>[5]</sup> Section 3 states: "The combination of this 'grand unified model' poll and Poll 4 heavily encourages the networking study group to produce a paper based on Senders and Receivers." The word "networking" in the poll text directed the committee's networking work toward the sender model.

**Q: P2300 has been refined since 2021.**

A: Section 4.1 documents the 2026 evidence. The error channel concern from [P2430R0](https://wg21.link/p2430r0)<sup>[12]</sup> (2021) is documented again in [P2762R2](https://wg21.link/p2762r2)<sup>[13]</sup> (2023). No sender-based networking deployment has been published.

**Q: The poll included "parallelism and GPUs" which are validated.**

A: This paper examines the word "networking." The parallelism and GPU evidence is documented in Section 3.1. The GPU deployments are real. The networking evidence column is empty.

**Q: You are arguing for your own library.**

A: Section 1 discloses this. Section 4.2 labels the author's own papers separately. The evidence in Sections 2 through 4 stands or falls on the published record, not on who assembled it.
